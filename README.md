# Climatic signatures in the COVID19 pandemic

Code and analysis for the manuscript "Climatic signatures in the different COVID-19 
pandemic waves across both hemispheres""


## Reproducibility

To be able to reproduce the experiments, you will need to have Python 3.8 installed.
We have used `poetry` as a dependency manager, so as to install the dependencies pinned
at the same versions we used, just run:
```
poetry install
```
In case you don't have `poetry` installed in your system, you can install it via `pip`:
```
pip install poetry
```
To enter into the poetry virtual environment, just run
```
poetry shell
```
In case that you don't have `poetry` in your system and would rather keep it that way,
you can install the dependencies via `pip` by using the `requirements.txt` file included:
```
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project structure

The folder is organized like the following:

```
.
├── code
│   ├── notebooks
│   └── src
├── data
│   ├── covid19
│   ├── density_grid
│   ├── era5
│   ├── intermediate_files
│   ├── process_based_model
│   └── shapes
└── results
    ├── figures
    └── tables

```

The code is organized in two folders:
+ `src`: which acts as a `python` module from which we can import auxiliary functions
  and classes.
  
+ `notebooks`: which contains the actual experiments. They should be ran top to bottom.
In certain cases, they include quite computationally expensive, and some pre-processed files are
  already included in the `data/` folder so that these can be skipped. The data sources used
  by these notebooks are stored in the `data` folder (or come from API calls directly in the code)
  and the results generated by the notebooks are stored in the `results` folder in `figures`
  or `tables` depending on the format.
